Steps for Setting up and Migrating CDB
--------------------------------------

1. Restore the most recent version of the CDB Database (if it is a test env), Else the existing production version works good.

2. Restore the most recent version of the SWS database

3. Execute the following CDB Scripts to create the structure for CDB Database by virtue of RMS
	a. 00_00_use_cdb			- to set the CDB as the default database
	b. 00_CDB_pre_migration_cleanup.sql	- to cleanup any unnecesary table in the old CDB Schema
	c. 01_CDB_primitives.sql		- to create the primitives reqd for the new set of tables
	d. 02_CDB_schema.sql			- to create the new set of CDB tables - by virtue of RMS
	e. 03_CDB_setup_data.sql		- to insert data in the new CDB tables
	f. 04_CDB_audit_schema.sql		- to create the audit tables for CDB
	
4. Execute the following script to migrate the data from existing to new CDB tables	
	g. 05_CDB_Migration_Restructuring.sql	- makes any changes to tables before migrating
	h. 06_CDB_Migration.sql
	i. 07_CDB_Restructuring.sql		
	j. 08_CDB_Migration.sql			

-- until this point, we have 
	- the new set of CDB tables added to the existing CDB database
	- the data has been populated on the new set of CDB tables
	- the data has been migrated from the old set of CDB tables to the new ones

-- Next we need to migrate CDB data from SWS

5. Execute the following two CBD Migration scripts, in order to migrate data from SWS to CDB
	k. 21_CDB_script.sql			- migrates data from SWS to CDB
	
6. Once the Migration is complete, we can now create the necessary triggers for the CDB , with foll script
	l. 09_CDB_Triggers.sql
