Steps for carrying out v6.08 release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IMPORTANT.	If the release for a Centre is being done, after Import at Zone, you need to execute 
				..ONLY that part of v6.08a.sql that is AFTER "Use ZSM".
			This is because at the Zone, centre's database is not ZSM, but ZSM_XXX.

1. Execute v6.08a.sql for ALL Centres (including Mumbai/zone)
2. Execute the appropriate Satang Centre-specific v6.08b.sql
